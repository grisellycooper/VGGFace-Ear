# VGGFace-Ear Dataset Annotations

This annotations were made over the existing VGGFace2 dataset (www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/)

Annotations are saved in CSV files, there is one file per set. The train set gathers 600 subject and the test set, 60 subjects.

Annotations are as follows: 

|NÂ°  | Field        | Type    | Description
|----| ------------ | --------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 1  | folder 	    | string 	| Class name given by the VGGFace dataset
| 2  | file_img 	  | string 	| Image or sample name given by the VGGFace datase
| 3  | num_object 	| int 	  | Order number of ear detected in the image using the Mask-RCNN
| 4  | score 	      | float 	| Detection score given by the Mask-RCNN
| 5  | y 		        | int 	  | Y Upper-left value of the bounding box given by the Mask-RCNN
| 6  | x 		        | int 	  | X Upper-left value of the bounding box given by the Mask-RCNN
| 7  | y2 		      | int 	  | Y Lower-right value of the bounding box given by the Mask-RCNN
| 8  | x 		        | int 	  | X Lower-right value of the bounding box given by the Mask-RCNN
| 9  | height 	    | int 	  | Calculated height given bounding box coordinates
| 10 | width 	      | int 	  | Calculated width given bounding box coordinates
| 11 | ratio 	      | float 	| Calculated aspect ratio given height and width
| 12 | mask_per 	  | float 	| Calculated percentage of pixels of the mask over the total number of pixels in the image
| 13 | ear_nonear 	| float 	| Classification score from the ears and non-ears classifier
